# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

## AI-Powered Features Setup

RupeeRadar uses Google's Gemini AI to provide smart transaction categorization and personalized spending insights. To use these features, you'll need to:

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
3. Add your API key to the `.env` file:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

This will enable:
- AI-powered transaction categorization
- Personalized spending insights
- Anomaly detection for unusual transactions

> Note: Without a valid API key, these features will display a user-friendly error message and fall back to basic functionality.
